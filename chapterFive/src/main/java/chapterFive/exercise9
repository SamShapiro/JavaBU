Homework 2, Chapter 5, Exercise 9

Find and correct the error(s) in each of the following segments of code:

a) 	Original:
	For (i = 100, i >= 1, i++) //"For" should not be capitalized, i should go down,
							   //i should be int, semicolons not commas
 		System.out.println(i)  //needs semicolon at end
 		
 	Correct:
 	for (int i = 100; i >= 1; i--)
 		System.out.println(i);
 		
b)	Original (should print out whether even or odd):
	switch (value % 2)
	{
 		case 0:
 			System.out.println("Even integer");  //needs to break here
 		case 1:
 			System.out.println("Odd integer");
	} 
	
	Correct:
	switch (value % 2)
	{
 		case 0:
 			System.out.println("Even integer");
 			break;
 		case 1:
 			System.out.println("Odd integer");
	} 
	
c)  Original (should output odd integers from 19 to 1):
	for (i = 19; i >= 1; i += 2) //i should be int, i should go down, not up
		System.out.println(i);
		
	Correct:
	for (int i = 19; i >= 1; i -= 2)
		System.out.println(i);
		
d)  Original (should output even integers from 2 to 100):
	counter = 2; //counter should be int
	do
	{
 		System.out.println(counter);
 		counter += 2;
	} While (counter < 100); //while should not be capitalized, counter should <= 100
	
	Correct:
	int counter = 2;
	do
	{
		System.out.println(counter);
		counter ==2;
	} while (counter <= 100);
