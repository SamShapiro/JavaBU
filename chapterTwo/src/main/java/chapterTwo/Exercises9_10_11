Homework 1 -  Chapter 2,  Exercises 2.9, 2.10, 2.11

2.9 State whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why.
a) Java operators are evaluated from left to right.
	-FALSE - the equals sign (=) is evaluated right to left.
	
b) The following are all valid variable names: _under_bar_, m928134, t5, j7, her_sales$,
his_$account_total, a, b$, c, z and z2.
	-TRUE (it is conventional to start with a letter and avoid "_" and "$", they are still valid)

c) A valid Java arithmetic expression with no parentheses is evaluated from left to right.
	-FALSE - Exponents are evaluated before multiplication/division, 
	which are evaluated before addition/subtraction, regardless of left to right.

d) The following are all invalid variable names: 3g, 87, 67h2, h22 and 2h.
	-FALSE - "h22" is a valid variable name




2.10 Assuming that x = 2 and y = 3, what does each of the following statements display?
a) System.out.printf("x = %d%n", x);
	-Displays "x = 2"
	
b) System.out.printf("Value of %d + %d is %d%n", x, x, (x + x));
	-Displays "Value of 2 + 2 is 4"
	
c) System.out.printf("x =");
	-Displays "x = "

d) System.out.printf("%d = %d%n", (x + y), (y + x));
	-Displays "5 = 5"


2.11 Which of the following Java statements contain variables whose values are modified?
a) p = i + j + k + 7;
	-"p" is modified to be equivalent to the other variables plus seven

b) System.out.println("variables whose values are modified");
	-literally yes, but for the purposes of the questions intent, no modified variables

c) System.out.println("a = 5");
	-No modified variables ("a" isn't a variable here, it's just part of the output)

d) value = input.nextInt();
	-"value" is modified to be the user's input
